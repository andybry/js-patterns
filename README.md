Studying design patterns and refactorings in JavaScript


## Purpose

This repository is used to create standard implentations of common object-orientated patterns and explore refactorings
in JavaScript.


## Core: Base.js

This is a standardised way of creating classes in JavaScript.

1. The code: [Base][Base]
2. An example of how to create a class: [Class][Class]
3. An example of how to handle inheritance: [Inheritance][Inheritance]
